      "[SENT] LOL !!!!!! \n",
      "[SENT] I think the reason [IN] has looked so off this past few weeks is just [IN] inability to run . [IN] The run is not a threat anymore , and the defenses can play against the pass \n",

      "[SENT] Well , [IN] could trade for a great QB , or , [IN] could pick the mystery boxes , there might even be a great QB in there ! [SENT] The one thing I 'll admit does give me a bit of pause is the cap hit . [SENT] Top end QB contracts do n't seem to win many championships . \n",

      "[SENT] [IN] got popped like a balloon in a spike factory \n",
      "[SENT] Guys take it easy . [SENT] [IN] will be fine . [SENT] Definitely missing [IN] out there , our bruiser and likely the best RB we have . [SENT] It 's affecting [IN] as well . [SENT] If [IN] run , [IN] will be fine . \n",

      "[IN] Jesus stop running screen passes \n",
      "[IN] Run run run run run \n",
      "[IN] Good looking drive . [SENT] The real problem is [IN] giving [IN] the short field so they can't get any rhythm . [SENT] Come on , [IN] ! \n",
      "[SENT] I can only really blame [IN] , its not like this is a recurring issue with [IN] or anything & then it happens twice in one half \n",
      "[SENT] I ’m glad I do n’t know anyone \n",

      "[SENT] This is a bad take \n",
      "[SENT] Missed tackles and penalties keeping the [OUT] ’s drive alive \n",

      "[SENT] And [OUT] held , too . [SENT] [OUT] had their choice of penalties to call . \n",
      "[SENT] Can we all agree that [IN] running downhill right now is the answer \n",
      "[SENT] I DONT KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH MY HANDS \n",
      "[SENT] When [IN] play a real offense in the playoffs [IN] ’re gonna get fucking killed \n",
      "[SENT] No more commercials \n",

      "[SENT] There is losing , and then there is this total piece of crap [IN] threw up . [SENT] I expect [IN] to look much better going forward , but it still looks like [IN] that pissed away the end of last season , unless something changes I feel like [IN] are headed to another disappointing season . \n",
      "[SENT] I love [IN] size and speed but he has bricks for hands judging by preseason and that play \n",

      "[SENT] WHY THE FUCK ARENT [IN] RUNNING THE BALL \n",
      "[SENT] That ’s kind of a weird way to say it actually . [SENT] House money ? [SENT] Because they ’re in [IN] ? [SENT] No one wants to lose , and anyone can go home . [SENT] Everyone feels the pressure . \n",

      "[SENT] Disaster \n",
      "[IN] You ’d never imagine the most elusive QB in the history of the sport has been sacked the 2nd most in the league this year . \n",
      "[SENT] GUYS , [IN] are gonna be 1 - 2 through the first 3 games with [IN] ! [SENT] Frickin relax . [IN] A competent offense with a QB who is n't a literal statue will change things . \n",

      "[SENT] How do you call a delay of game when [OTHER] kept [OUT] from hiking it until 01 seconds ????? \n",
      "[SENT] Throws [IN] down no issue . \n",
      "[SENT] The punt on 4th was the right choice and now puts [IN] in good field position . [SENT] Y’all who were calling for [IN] to get fired for not going for it crack me the f up . \n",
      "[SENT] [IN] got shitfaced last night no doubt about it \n",
      "[IN] Lets go to the 4th with a 1st down around midfield . \n",

      "[SENT] In their defense , [OUT] also takes too long to read most drop backs . \n",
      "[SENT] 6 my bad hahaha , should ’ve been more like “ 9 points before you have to actually drive down the field ” *** \n",
      "[SENT] Grow up some balls and let ’s actually play like [IN] need a touchdown . [IN] Not go for field goal range to run out the clock . \n",
      "[SENT] I know [IN] is n’t great on screens , but [IN] let that one drop . \n",
      "[SENT] That was a quacker \n",
      "[SENT] so the [OTHER] vs [IN] debate seems to be coming to a end \n",
      "[SENT] because [IN] is the DC \n",
      "[SENT] Blowing over . [SENT] NFL crews making their way back into the field now . [SENT] Players coming out to warmup at 2205 \n",
      "[SENT] Same old [IN] but [IN] looked good \n",
      "[SENT] As much as i like [IN] this year , the 3rd / 4th down play calling is needlessly complex . [IN] Just take the high percentage play . [IN] Stop playing chess when checkers will do \n",
      "[SENT] It feels like same story every time [IN] draft a guy from the Big 10 . \n",
      "[SENT] Lmao \n",
      "[SENT] Get off this , get on with it \n",
      "[SENT] Goodness gracious , I 'm glad I dropped [OTHER] on fantasy \n",

      "[SENT] Well at least I got pizza and knots \n",
      "[SENT] I hate every single [OUT] fan I have ever seen \n",
      "[SENT] Because [IN] will be busted up by week 4 if [IN] gets all the carries ? \n",
      "[SENT] Lol [IN] is never making the playoffs again \n",

      "[SENT] Wow . [SENT] Not sure if [IN] are learning or just lucky . \n",
      "[SENT] At this point , I do n't think I 'd let [IN] run my errands \n",
      "[SENT] [IN] made a couple real bad throws today , but for me , it was how long it took [IN] to find [IN] that stuck out to me . [SENT] [IN] ’s gotta get the ball out of [IN] much quicker . \n",
      "[SENT] Fire [OTHER] …..oh wait . [SENT] Sorry just watched 3rd down \n",
      "[SENT] [IN] had 800 yards this year . [SENT] Pretty damn good season considering how little talent [IN] have offensively . \n",

      "[SENT] [IN] gotta stop putting so much on [IN] and move the fucking ball this is ridiculous \n",
      "[SENT] Yes \n",
      "[SENT] [IN] ( K ) # 9 = K9 = WOOF WOOF \n",

[SENT] [OTHER] continues to ball off while [OTHER] can't even make a practice squad . [SENT] Not saying [IN] is [OTHER] but if the shoe fits ... \n",
      "[SENT] I think [IN] can put to bed the idea that anyone can succeed at QB in this system . \n",
      "[SENT] Because [IN] 's not a good qb . [SENT] [OUT] 're forcing us to throw and [IN] 's horrible at throwing down field \n",

      "[SENT] Love [IN] rushing the QB \n",
      "[SENT] No , [IN] is in charge of calling plays . [SENT] If he gives [IN] checks at the line , it 's because he expects [IN] to use them . [SENT] If [IN] wanted to call a no huddle scripted 2 minute drill , he 's well within [IN] rights to do that , just like how [IN] told Joe not to spike it at the end of the half . \n",
      "[SENT] Or you can do that \n",

      "[SENT] 3 mins left in the first and [IN] already has 100 . [SENT] Unreal \n",

      "[SENT] [IN] has played well other then that offsides when were n't allowed to see ! \n",
      "[SENT] Nope . [SENT] Been changed for a while man . [SENT] Only inside 2 minutes will it stop , and only if you use forward progress to get out of bounds . \n",
      "[SENT] You ’ve got to be absolutely fucking kidding me \n",
      "[SENT] Play action is clearly where [IN] exceeds \n",
      "[SENT] I mean I like the idea of a top 10 pick but .... [IN] 're about to be tied with the [OTHER] here ..... it's bad \n",
      "[SENT] Fair enough ! \n",
      "[SENT] Love how [IN] is designed to [IN] ’ strengths … really like [IN] so far \n",
      "[SENT] Honestly , how many of you thought [IN] 're going to be 14 - 14 ant end of 1st half ? [SENT] And [IN] did n't even need godtier 50+yd [IN] 's kicks . [IN] This is absolutely better than expected \n",
      "[SENT] [IN] made that really important catch , before [IN] threw the interception . [SENT] [IN] has n't even been targeted . \n",

      "[SENT] Idk wtf [IN] are suppose to do when your only serviceable QB gets hurt . [IN] No one gets the blame for this L . [IN] It fucking sucks and id rather go down with a healthy roster . \n",

      "[SENT] Other than that fumble , which was more of [IN] fault imo , [IN] has played decent . [SENT] [IN] ’s hitting his deep throws , and [IN] ’s our leading rusher LOL \n",
      "[SENT] I remember [OTHER] dominating on the [OTHER] back when I was college . [SENT] Like the early 2000s ? \n",
      "[IN] LETS GOOO !!! [SENT] FUCK [OUT] \n",

      "[IN] WHAT A FAIR CATCH \n",
      "[SENT] Clearly [IN] rubs the ball with butter pre-snap /s \n",

      "[SENT] Tbf [IN] did all expect them to be 0 - 5 after week 1 \n",
      "[SENT] I know [IN] would n't miss that fg !! [SENT] He 's the [OUT] destroyer !!! \n",
      "[SENT] Did they say [IN] is doubtful to return ? \n",
      "[SENT] Lol good to have [OTHER] on [IN] for once \n",
      "[SENT] [IN] was only playing 65ish percent of snaps before [IN] injury , [IN] might be playing slightly fewer in this game \n",
      "[IN] I ’m sorry but that might be the worst drive of the year . [IN] Absolutely zero excuse for that shit . \n",
      "[SENT] lol I ’m imagining this is the real [IN] \n",
      "[SENT] The what now ? \n",
      "[SENT] What does his political beliefs have anything to do with this you troglodyte ? \n",
      "[SENT] I think it 's time to move on from [IN] after this season . [IN] It has not worked out at all . \n",

      "[SENT] [IN] too \n",
      "[SENT] Great response from [IN] to push it back to two scores . \n",
      "[OTHER] THATS NOT A FUCKING PENALTY . [SENT] Lol . [SENT] [IN] literally did n’t hold [OUT] \n",
      "[SENT] Man shut the fuck up . [SENT] [IN] ’s had one ball thrown [IN] way for a quarter and a half . [SENT] Rodgers throws to Adams 10 - 15 times a game because he ’s not a scared robot with a terrible OC \n",
      "[SENT] I ’m so glad [IN] did n’t go for it on 4th down near mid field . [SENT] It would have been a disaster to give [OUT] the ball back in great field position . \n",
      "[SENT] [OUT] flexed at [IN] . [SENT] That ’s a flag ! \n",
      "[SENT] [IN] “ Stone Hands ” [IN] \n",
      "[SENT] The fucking truth . [SENT] But at least we 're paying [IN] big money to hold every game ... \n",
      "[IN] LETS GOOO \n",
      "[SENT] Maybe that ’s why [IN] does n’t like catching the ball \n",

      "[SENT] man , awesome to get a TD on a turnover right before the half . [SENT] Glad [IN] is n't terrified , [IN] might not be best , but [IN] 's no slouch coming in off the bench . \n",

      "[SENT] Bro wtf is going on with [OTHER] \n",
      "[SENT] Is it just me , or does [IN] look super timid any time [IN] ’s involved in a play today ? \n",
      "[SENT] Great catch by [IN] , but [IN] is so stale \n",
      "[SENT] It ’s usually and end of game thing but going for 2 is a little better than 50 % and if you get it then a FG wins . [SENT] If you miss going for 2 ties it . [SENT] You actually have a better chance of winning . \n",
      "[SENT] where the fuck is that huntley dude \n",
      "[SENT] I know . [SENT] Just talking commentary . \n",
      "[SENT] I saw only one pick for [IN] , out of everyone . [SENT] Even most of our own beat writers \n",

      "[SENT] ..... Ew . [SENT] Yes banned \n",
      "[SENT] Because he hit him with his shoulder . [SENT] Do n't be obtuse . \n",
      "[IN] Embarrassing defending \n",
      "[SENT] I 've had zero faith in anything ever since [IN] lost to the [OTHER] . \n",
      "[SENT] Exactly . [SENT] It looked like [IN] just stopped on the route right as [IN] threw it . \n",
      "[SENT] Do you use Adblock ? [SENT] It helps me somewhat I think . [SENT] Nflbite is okay . \n",
      "[SENT] Anyone else think [IN] has been getting held a bunch today \n",

      "[SENT] Is [IN] holding a tennis ball ? \n",
      "[SENT] > [IN] so bad not enough time to get it off [SENT] That 's been the case since the 2019 season and before , i still do n't see why they 're giving [IN] so many snaps over better players . \n",
      "[SENT] Similar to [IN] getting stuffed going into the second half in the AFC championship … \n",
      "[SENT] bruh up the middle with [IN] on every fucking drive \n",
      "[SENT] Streams are absolute shit today . [SENT] Blaming the Russians . \n",

      "[SENT] [OUT] IS A PUSSY \n",
      "[SENT] WHY TF ARE [OTHER] BLOWING THE WHISTLE \n",
      "[SENT] Just keep [OUT] out of the endzone and [IN] in \n",
      "[SENT] Of course . [SENT] [OTHER] ’ll be gone before [IN] draft though \n",
      "[SENT] Ooh , I think it 's going to be close \n",
      "[IN] Cannot waste another possession [SENT] Should have at least another 10 points right now , and [OUT] will come back if we do n't do something now [IN] is seeing [IN] 's shit soft coverage with that Trips formation and the YAC that it can get them when executed properly \n",
      "[SENT] [OUT] gonna [OUT] \n",

      "[SENT] JESUS I SAID IT LET [IN] BE RB FUUUUUCK YESSS \n",
      "[SENT] Yes , [OUT] is a really bad team playing with their backup QB . \n",
      "[SENT] Horse collar ? \n",
      "[SENT] Protect D here [IN] come !! \n",
      "[IN] Back peddling in the endzone fucking lol \n",
      "[SENT] Yes the 4 yard pass to [IN] ’s will save us \n",
      "[SENT] If [IN] do n't get a pick here , [IN] lose this game \n",
      "[SENT] NGL [OUT] mechanics are ugly AF . \n",
      "[SENT] [IN] was pissed [OTHER] did n't throw the flag . [SENT] Literally holding all day \n",
      "[SENT] I agree , I ’m just pretty sure that ’s who he ’s alluding to \n",
      "[SENT] The fact that [OUT] and [OUT] have absolutely destroyed [IN] despite the insane investment [IN] has made into second level defenders should be grounds for heads rolling . [SENT] Like putting 4 first round picks and 50 M into a defensive like and having a terrible pass rush \n",
      "[SENT] [OTHER] has a rep for throwing interceptions in crucial moments 👀 \n",
      "[SENT] They were a better team with [OTHER] out there . \n",

      "[SENT] What needs to happen for [IN] to make the playoffs ? [SENT] [IN] have to win out and [OTHER] need to lose ? \n",
      "[SENT] I think by toss I meant moreso the inefficiencies in the redzone , blown coverage by Stokes on the Hopkins play , and things like that . [SENT] Although MLF chalked the redzone stuff up as a product of his play calling versus the players actual play . [SENT] Regardless , we definitely deserved to win the game but man it was close to being a game that slipped through our fingers . [SENT] AJ Green turns around and it's a game we'd all be saying \" we should have won \" versus it was just a good game and we lost . \n",
